# Solar_system_simulation
The code is based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTLPmUHTPqo but I have extended it to be more interactive and give a better experience for the user using three modules: pygame, math and time.
The simulation uses real-world data such as astronomical unit, gravitational constant and distances between planets.
It uses two directories which contain the pictures in png format for the planets and the surfaces (I am aware that gas giants do not have solid surfaces so I used pictures where you can see the planet from a moon's/other planet's surface).
